#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to building and maintaining high quality software applications.
- Importance
    * Quality
    * Efficiency
    * Scalability
    * Security
    * User satisfaction

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of programming languages in the 1960s.
- Advent of structured programming language (OOP) in the 1980s.
- Rise of methodologies like agile in the 2000s

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: entails the system or business requirement document.
- Design: this where the architecture and UI of the app is being designed.
- Implementation: this is the stage where the actual coding and building of the app is done.
- Testing: test is carried out on the app to ensure it's of high quality and meets users requirement.
- Deployment: app is being released to the for public use.
- Maintenance: monitoring, support and updates to enhance the app.

4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall: It's linear and sequential. Happens in phases - planning, design, implementation, etc. It follows a strict order. This model is better for stable, predictable projects. 
- Agile: It:s iterative and flexible. Development occurs in short cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback. This model is better for dynamic, user-driven development.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: writes the code to build a software application
- QA Engineer: tests the application that has been built for quality to meet users needs.
- Project Manager: oversees the planning, execution and delivery of the software product.


6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing codes. E.g. VScode, Intellij, Eclipse.
- VCS are software tools for tracking changes to made to a source code and coordinating work among team members. E.g. Git, Subversion.

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

    * The challenges faced includes;
- Changing rquirements: Scope creep and project delay may occure when requirements keeps changing.
- Tight deadlines: Tight deadlines can lead to pressure which in turn leads to a rushed development with a compromised quality.
- Technical debts: Taking shoertcuts or suboptimal decisions in delivering a product will over time lead to higher maintenance cost and a decreased overall quality of the app.

    * The strategies to overcoming these challenges includes;
- Employing agile methodologies.
- Prioritization of tasks
- Regularly reassessing goals and timelines.
- Communicating effectively.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- Unit testing: involves testing individual components of the software application.
- Integration testing: involves testing between different components or subsystems of the software application.
- System testing: involves testing the entire system as a whole.
- Acceptance testing: involves testing the software application against the business requirement to ensure it meets the users need.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

- Definition: Prompt engineering is the process of giving clear and concise instructions to an AI model in order to get a desired and best possible results from the AI model.
- Importance: The importance of prompt engineering while Interacting with AI models is so that the AI understands our needs and doees not give us a confusing or misleading response but gives a clear, specific and concise response.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

- Vague prompt: Generate a code that builds an application.
- Improved prompt: Generate a python code that builds the login flow of a fintech application with step by step usage and explanation.
